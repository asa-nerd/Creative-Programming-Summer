Code and Examples for my lecture ›Creative Programming‹ at the University of Art and Design Linz.

The summer semester provides more detailed informations on strategies used in creative applications of code. The main tools are langueages of the Processing family (P5/JavaScript, Processing/Java), but Python might cross our path here and then. 

The exact theme usually changes every year, but right now the focus is on producing Generative Art with the Pen Plotter.
